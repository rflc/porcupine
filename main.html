    <p>
    Kalle Ronkko has long-term experience in developing real time trading, back testing, and simulation systems with Tuomas Karjalainen. Kalle Ronkko, who has devised, for example, a robust valuation model for publicly-listed preferred shares risk management system. Currently, he is expanding our in-house trading model into the crypto-currency world. Even though all of these implementations have not yet been accomplished, we have a working project which is based on collaborating basically according to the protocol of the so-called Agile Software developing system. “Agile” is an umbrella term for several iterative and incremental software development methodologies. We have not afforded resources for heavy waterfall style processes. We are lean.
